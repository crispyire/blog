My friend and colleague at [Triangle Computer Services](https://twitter.com/TriangleCS); [Ross Wynne](https://twitter.com/RossWynne) also got selected and Iâ€™m very excited to be working alongside him as one of only 115 people worldwide to be selected to evangelise VMware NSX.

I am very humbled to be part of such a select group of the vExpert community.
