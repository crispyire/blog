![vExpert 2016 Logo](https://i0.wp.com/www.baylyparker.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/VMW-LOGO-vEXPERT-2016-k.png?resize=938%2C136)This afternoon, I got notification that I have been awarded [vExpert 2016](http://blogs.vmware.com/vmtn/2016/02/vexpert-2016-award-announcement.html) for the second time. The VMware award makes me enormously proud to be part of the community that is so supportive and welcoming.

VMware states the vExperts are:

*Each of these vExperts have demonstrated significant contributions to the community and a willingness to share their expertise with others. Contributing is not always blogging or Twitter as there are many public speakers, book authors, script writers, VMUG leaders, VMTN community moderators and internal champions among this group.*

It was my fellow vExpert [Paul Meehan](https://twitter.com/PaulPMeehan), who introduced me to the vExpert programme last year. Iâ€™m please that was the start of meeting many more fantastic people who have supported me and my stranger questions ever since. This year I was joined in my company ([Triangle Computer Services](http://www.triangle.ie)) by [Ross Wynne](https://twitter.com/RossWynne) who have also been awarded vExpert 2016.

For those reasons and many more, I am very grateful to [VMware](http://vmware.com/) and [Corey](https://twitter.com/vCommunityGuy) for their fantastic work in making this community such a great place to be a member off.
