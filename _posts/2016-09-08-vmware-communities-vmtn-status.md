If you have ever wondered what the statuses attached to profiles in the [VMware Communities](https://communities.vmware.com/) (VMTN) forum are? Or want to get more involved in helping the VMware community out by asking/answering questions; I hope this is helpful to you.

Below is a list of VMTN statuses that I have come across (If there are more, please let me know and Iâ€™ll add them in)
