# VMware Certified Professional 6 – Cloud Management and Automation Exam (VCP6-CMA / 2V0-631)

[![VMware Certified Professional 6 Cloud Management & Automation](https://i0.wp.com/www.baylyparker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/vcp6-cma-sm-logo_120_108.png?resize=120%2C108)](https://i0.wp.com/www.baylyparker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/vcp6-cma-sm-logo_120_108.png)

During a recent meeting with my boss at [Triangle Computer Services](http://www.triangle.ie/), I was asked if I would take the [VCP6-CMA Exam](https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm?plan=64298&ui=www_cert&src=vmw_so_vex_cpark_1033) to enhance our capabilities in the automation field. I naturally jumped at the opportunity, but as this in a very new offering by [VMware Education](https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrreg/index.cfm?src=vmw_so_vex_cpark_1033) and I found the resources available for study in short supply.

There are some recommended training provided by VMware and its training partners for anyone wanting to take this exam (I did the *vRealize Automation: Install, Configure, Manager* course):

[Cloud Orchestration and Extensibility \[V6.1](https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrreg/courses.cfm?ui=www_edu&a=one&id_subject=56449&src=vmw_so_vex_cpark_1033)\]  
[vRealize Business: Costing and Implementation \[V8.0\]](https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrreg/courses.cfm?ui=www_edu&a=one&id_subject=60145&src=vmw_so_vex_cpark_1033)  
[vRealize Automation: Install, Configure, Manage \[V6.0\]](https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrreg/courses.cfm?ui=www_edu&a=one&id_subject=52386&src=vmw_so_vex_cpark_1033)  
[Cloud Orchestration and Extensibility \[V6.X\]](https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrreg/courses.cfm?ui=www_edu&a=one&id_subject=56449&src=vmw_so_vex_cpark_1033)  
Cloud Automation: Design &amp; Deploy \[V6.0\]  
vRealize Automation: Install, Configure, Manage \[V6.0\] On Demand  
vRealize Automation: Install, Configure, Manage \[V6.2\] On Demand

and a practice exam:

[VCP6-CMA (2V0-631) Practice Exam](http://mylearn.vmware.com/quiz.cfm?item=64772&src=vmw_so_vex_cpark_1033)

Over the next few weeks, I’ll post my notes as I complete each section.
