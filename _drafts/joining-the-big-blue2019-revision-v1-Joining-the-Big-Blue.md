After just over five years it’s time to say goodbye to Triangle Computer Services. I have had an amazing time working with some great clients, colleagues and diving deeper into the VMware SDDC stack.

I want to thank Triangle for the great opportunities of working with every sector of the industry from governments, telcos, finance to oil companies. Over the last year, I have been honoured also to work on behalf of VMware PSO as one of their Senior Consultants working on projects that have touched nearly every current product VMware offer.

It’s now time to move on and I have signed up with IBM as a VMware Subject Matter Expert (SME) as part of the Critical Response Team (CRT) coving Europe. Though I will be based out of Ireland, I will be traveling throughout Europe with a multidisciplinary team of ‘boots on the ground’ experts to deal with whatever is thrown at us.

*If you can keep your head when all about you*

*are losing theirs and blaming it on you,*

*Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,*

*And—which is more—you’ll be a VMware SME*

As the title suggests, I will be the ‘VMware guy’ so I will continue to be deeply involved with the VMware product stack, Ireland VMUG and writing VMware certifications.

…but for the next couple of weeks, I’ll take a break; have fun with the family and look forward to the challenges ahead.
