In my last post, I started to explain my re-interest in End User Computing (EUC) as I entered the world of Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI). In this post, I wanted to look deeper into thin and zero clients combined with VDI.

After I had set up the VMware Horizon View infrastructure in my home lab; I was able to bring up a Windows 7 desktop on my Macbook Air. But though that demonstrated the mobility aspects that View can offer; it didn’t give me the insight into how many companies and organisations are using VDI in their workplace today. Namely, I wanted to see how VDI worked on zero and thin clients. I was lucky enough to be offered a couple to try out by 10Zig Technologies and it’s been a real insight in how a product can be made that embodies making life simple for the end user and the administrator alike.

### **Zero and Thin Clients**

Firstly, what is a zero and thin client? A zero client has a very cut down Operating System (OS) and no hard drive. The sole purpose of a zero client is to facilitate a connection to VDI. In contrast a thin client’s purpose is the same but also could include some essential applications natively/locally.

### **10Zig Technologies**

10Zig Technologies offer a huge range of thin and zero clients at are VMware, Citrix and Microsoft ready certified. The present product range includes [12 different clients](http://www.10zig.com/product/vmware-certified_thin_clients/) that are [VMware Ready Certified](http://www.vmware.com/resources/compatibility/) which is the focus of my blog today.

### **10Zig V1200**

The V1200 I looked at is a zero client that connects via PCoIP to your View Connection Server. I could write about how it has dual screen capabilities, 4 USB ports and other features such as USB Smart Card options but what really impressed me was the zero setup time. I did the basic setup of plugging in power, USB keyboard/mouse, a monitor and lastly a network cable and then it was time to turn it on. After less than a couple of seconds of hitting the power button, I’m prompted with the login screen to my View Connection Server! There was no time consuming setup, no install; just a login screen to my View setup. The ‘wow’ moment of out-of-the-box to running without any setup just blew me away.
