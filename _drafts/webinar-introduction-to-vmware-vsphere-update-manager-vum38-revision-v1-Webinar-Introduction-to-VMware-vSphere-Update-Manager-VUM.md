In the summer of 2014, I was very kindly asked by Veeam Software to present a webinar on VMware vSphere Update Manager. With a lot of excitement and a lot of “What I have got myself into”, I said yes, and setup about writing something I thought people would find interesting.

With my good friend Johan Huttenga ([@johanhuttenga](https://twitter.com/johanhuttenga "@johanhuttenga")), in November 2014, we presented my first webinar… Though there was some technical difficulties with my router (It died completely that night!), I hope it was useful to people.
