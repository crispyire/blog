# VMware Certified Professional 6 – Cloud Management and Automation Exam (VCP6-CMA / 2V0-631)

During a recent meeting with my boss at [Triangle Computer Services](http://www.triangle.ie/), I was asked if I would take the [VCP6-CMA Exam](https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm?plan=64298&ui=www_cert) to enhance our capabilities in the automation field. I naturally jumped at the opportunity, but as this in a very new offering by [VMware Education](https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrreg/index.cfm) found the resources available for study in short supply.

There are some recommended training provided by VMware and its training partners for anyone wanting to take this exam (I did the *vRealize Automation: Install, Configure, Manager* course):

[Cloud Orchestration and Extensibility \[V6.1](https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrreg/courses.cfm?ui=www_edu&a=one&id_subject=56449)\]  
[vRealize Business: Costing and Implementation \[V8.0\]](https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrreg/courses.cfm?ui=www_edu&a=one&id_subject=60145)  
[vRealize Automation: Install, Configure, Manage \[V6.0\]](https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrreg/courses.cfm?ui=www_edu&a=one&id_subject=52386)  
[Cloud Orchestration and Extensibility \[V6.X\]](https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrreg/courses.cfm?ui=www_edu&a=one&id_subject=56449)  
Cloud Automation: Design &amp; Deploy \[V6.0\]  
vRealize Automation: Install, Configure, Manage \[V6.0\] On Demand  
vRealize Automation: Install, Configure, Manage \[V6.2\] On Demand

and a practice exam:

I have decided to post my notes, which though are mainly copies of sections of VMware documentation, I hope they prove useful for those also going for the exam. Below are the sections that are listed in the official exam blueprint as of the 21-Aug-2015 (Please check if it was been updated at the time of your study).

- **Section 1:** Install, Configure and Upgrade vRealize Suite Components 
    - **Objective 1.1:** Explain vRealize Suite Editions and Features
    - **Objective 1.2:** Install and Upgrade vRealize Suite Components
    - **Objective 1.3:** Configure and Administer vCloud Connector
