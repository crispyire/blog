When studying for my VCAP6-DCV Deploy, I was developed an Excel sheet to help me understand the password string to change the vSphere password complexity requirements.

<span id="PRODUCTNAME_151DEB637A324DC9B6DDD7091D718B38">Based on the vSphere [documentation](https://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-65/topic/com.vmware.vsphere.security.doc/GUID-DC96FFDB-F5F2-43EC-8C73-05ACDAE6BE43.html) **ESXi**</span> **Passwords and Account Lockout**, I created the below spreadsheet to help calculate the string and increase your vSphere security.

You can download the spreadsheet from [here](http://www.baylyparker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Password-Calc.xlsx)

I hope it can help you.
