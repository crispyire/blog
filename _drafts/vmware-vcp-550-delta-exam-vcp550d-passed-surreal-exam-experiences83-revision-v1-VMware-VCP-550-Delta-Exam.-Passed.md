After an unsuccessful attempt two weeks ago to pass my VCAP-DCA (VDCA510), I needed to recoup after the disappointment of the email that delivered the bad news (Result 270â€¦ Needed 300) and think what next?!

With the introduction of vSphere 6 last week, I have to think about what I want to do for my advanced level certification, but meanwhile VMware had already sent me an email to say I needed to pass my VCAP or renew my VCP or loss my certification.

As I previously have said, I need to work out the next stage, but meanwhile I booked my VCP550 Delta exam to update my VCP510. Though I had issues booking the exam as somehow I had ended up with two Candidate IDs, and had to open a trouble ticket with Pearson Vue and VMware Education to get it resolved. 6 calls, 2 web chats, 1 Facebook message and a tweet I got it sorted and booked my exam.
