![time bomb for vSphere 5.0 vSphere 5.1](https://i0.wp.com/www.baylyparker.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/time_bomb.jpg?resize=300%2C160)This is just a quick post to remind people to start planning (and implementing) their upgrade of their VMware environment(s). It has now been a week since vSphere 5.0 and vSphere 5.1 and its components have [ended their general support from VMware](https://kb.vmware.com/kb/2145103).

Though VMware announced on 9th February 2016 the End of Availability of all versions of vSphere 5.0 and 5.1; I know many organisations across multiple industries that haven’t either got a plan to do their upgrade or haven’t implemented it yet. It’s time to do that upgrade!

If you need help with completing the upgrade; you can avail of a number of [VMware Partners](https://partnerlocator.vmware.com/) or [VMware Professional Service](http://www.vmware.com/consulting/) to help ease the pain.
