Iâ€™m currently in the process of upgrading a number of hosts in an environment. I needed to see the status of the host upgrading and patching process. Below is an easy way to get a list of ESXi host versions and build numbers via Powershell/PowerCLI.

```
<pre class="brush: powershell; title: ; notranslate" title="">

Get-View -ViewType HostSystem -Property Name,Config.Product | Format-Table Name, @{L='Host Version &amp; Build Version';E={$_.Config.Product.FullName}}

```
